# RESTful-API

A basic web application that demonstrates RESTful web services using a Twitter database in JSON format - this is a backend project. Information is returned from the server using simple HTTP requests, then displayed on the web page. There are currently five functions: fetching all tweets, fetching all users, fetching all links contained in tweets, finding a tweet by ID, and finding a specific user. 

If running the app locally, run node on the Node.js file and access the web page on localhost/3000. The five functions can be accessed with the following HTTPS requests:


If running the app on heroku, reoplace ... with ... to access the HTTPS requests.
